# AWS Cloud Resume Challenge
The Cloud Resume Challenge for AWS is a public, hands-on project designed to build and showcase cloud skills. In this challenge, I built a resume website hosted on AWS services, applying a variety of cloud technologies in shown in the architecture diagram below. Through developing and deploying this website, I gained valuable practical skills, underlining core concepts essential for a career in AWS cloud. This project was created by Forrest Brazeal and credit for creation of this project goes to him.
