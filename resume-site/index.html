      <h2>SUMMARY</h2>
      <hr class="thickline">
      <p class="text">Certified AWS Solutions Architect-Associate that excels at rapid skill acquisition and adaptation, demonstrated by a successful transition into tech
post-college via self-study. Through a two-year Air Force Officer training program, I developed leadership skills and the ability to excel in both
team-based and individual scenarios. This experience, combined with my long-term tech self-study, has equipped me with strong interpersonal skills
and the adaptability to thrive in changing or unpredictable work environments. I am actively seeking entry-level AWS Cloud opportunities to improve
and leverage these skills while making meaningful contributions to the industry.
